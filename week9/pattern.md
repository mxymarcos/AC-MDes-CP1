# Pattern, rhythm, movement

For this project, I'm creating a "flow field" with p5.js. 

I first came across a flow field example on OpenProcessing and loved it. It reminded me of the beautiful [antelope canyon](https://tinyurl.com/2p8enbus) in Page, AZ. 

I decided to follow a guide as I was still not really familiar with p5.js. I followed a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-QXuR-XX_s) so it'd help me understand how to achieve the look I was going for. 

The most interesting challenge to me was experimenting with different parameters and introducing color variations in the HSB color space. After tweaking the stroke density as well as the multiplier, I finally made it look [the way I intended](https://editor.p5js.org/mxymarcos/full/2ToMknqg3). With the help of additional for loops, I was also able to add smooth pastel gradient to the strokes. 

## Final result
