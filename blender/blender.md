# Building a product interface in Blender

For this project, I'm creating a home studio environment to show case the new web interface I designed for SoundCloud. 

I added equipments and tools commonly found in music studios. My product is targeted towards small music producers, so instead of using models of larger consoles/mixers, I ended up going with more modest equipments. 

I also started building the backdrop - I'm planning on making the back wall covered with acoustic panels in order to make this scene more realistic. Next I'll be focusing on the lighting in the studio. 

When my UI prototype is ready I will plug it in and animate the scene. 

This is what the studio looks like now:
