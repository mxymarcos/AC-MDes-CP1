# Time & oscillation


## Screenshots
![p1.png](p1.png)\
An early iteration of the oscillating circles.

A very interesting pattern I was able to capture.

Started fine tuning the amount & sizes of the circles.

![p4.png](p4.png)\
Interesting pattern but maybe I need to add more circles. I also started fine tuning movement speed, etc.

At this point I was pretty happy with the pattern & the movement.

![p6.png](p6.png)\
Added changing background colors.
